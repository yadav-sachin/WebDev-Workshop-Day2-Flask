## Tasks to be done
1. Deploy the Flask application on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
2. In Database, for movies, we stored id, name, rating and creation time. Now add another attribute of "body", which is a text attribute for the movie review. Make changes to the Edit-Add page accordingly. Also reflect the body data in the "index.html" templates.
3. Add Buttons on the Home page for the user to sort the Movie Reviews by Names, Genre, Date Created or Movie Ratings.
4. In our application, when the movie was added/edited successfully or there was a failure, we didn't show [alert messages](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) to user for success or failure. Add these alerts to the application. 
5. While adding a Movie Review, the user should be able to upload a thumbnail image for the movie. The thumbnail images of the movies will be listed along with their details on the homepage.

## Instructions:

- You are free to use any remote Database. However, avoid using a file-based database like SQLite that we used during the workshop.
